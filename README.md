This exercise will be made outside Zemoga and delivered between the next 3 days that follows this test.


## Layout HTML-CSS

- Rely on HTML5 semantics
- Rely on CSS3 features as possible

Requirements:
- [x] Use media queries to adapt the layout in small screens. (comp not provided, so use your creativity).
- [x] Non safe web font used: Lato (Available on Google fonts)
- [x] You can make use of preprocessors / transpilers to help you develop this test if you want (not mandatory)
- [x] Clicking on one of the links of the main menu redirects the user to the other pages (we only provide a comp for the main page so just use white pages with the title section on them).


## Interaction - JS:

Just add interaction for the middle voting boxes: Kanye West, Mark Zuckerberg, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Malala Yousafzai.

Requirements:
- [x] Create a data feed in JSON format with the structure that best suits the data for the voting boxes.
- [x] The user can select either thumb up or thumb down button (when the button is selected, a white border is displayed as featured in the comp)
- [x] Once the user clicks on the "Vote now” button, a message is displayed saying “Thank you for voting!” as well as a vote again button to vote again.
- [x] There is no limit in the amount of votes
- [x] Percentage bars change depending on the up/or downs votes.
- [x] Think on a way to persist the data. (could be local in the browser or server side if you have those skills)
- [x] We want to see your vanilla/DOM JS skills so please do not use jQuery.
- [x] You can solve this part with either full Vanilla JS and some patterns, OR any sort of framework such as Angular, React, Vuejs, Ember, etc. Use the one you feel more confortable with.
- [ ] Bonus points: Some sort of Test (E2E, BDD, etc)

> Please Note that the purpose of this exercise is to verify your coding skills as well as your abilities to code structure and quality,  best practices and standards. Rely on your best practices in terms of documentation, structure, semantics, performance, accessibility and modular CSS, as well as javascript best practices (style, patterns, modularity, readability, etc). 

Show us a glimpse of what you love to do (and know the best of).

## Delivery

Send a link pointing to your repository (Github, Bitbucket) including 2 branches. One with the layout part and another one with the interactive part.
The master branch should contain the entire exercise.
